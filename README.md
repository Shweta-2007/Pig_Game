Title: Pig Game - A JavaScript-Based Dice Game

Description:
The "Pig Game" is a web-based, two-player dice game developed using core web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project not only provides entertainment but also serves as an excellent example of front-end game development and JavaScript programming. Here are the technical details:

Key Technical Features:

DOM Manipulation: The Document Object Model (DOM) is utilized extensively to update and display game elements in real-time, including scores, dice images, and player status.

Event Handling: Event listeners are used to respond to user interactions such as button clicks for rolling the dice, holding the current score, and starting a new game.

Player Switching: The project implements player switching logic based on the outcome of dice rolls and the predefined winning score (in this case, 100 points).

Winning Conditions: The game checks for the winning condition where one player reaches or exceeds 100 points and declares the winner while preventing further gameplay.
